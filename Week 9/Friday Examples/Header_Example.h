/*
* This week, we will work through creating a multi-file program.
*
* Program requirements:
*
* You have been tasked with creating a small program that tracks
* pets at a kennel. It should have the following functionalities:
*
* 1) There should be a way to keep track of pets currently at the
* kennel.
* 2) There should be a way to keep track of pets who have been 
* adopted.
* 3) There should be a way to add pets to the kennel list, and to
* mark whether or not they are adoptable.
* Bonus: Try to make a file that allows you to persist these changes
* between program runs.
