/*
* I mentioned an employee class during Wednesday's lecture.
* Let's design a program that has the following characteristics:
* - An employee struct that has the employee's name, email, age and position.
* - A create employee function that creates an employee
* - A promotion function that changes the employee's position.
* - A termination function which fires and deletes the employee.
